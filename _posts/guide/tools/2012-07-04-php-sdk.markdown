The PHP SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [PHP](http://www.php.net).
It  hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk)

Initialize the SDK with your __client_id__ as follows:

{% highlight php5 %}
<?php
// Try to put this code at the top (attention to the path)
require '../MercadoLivre/meli.php';

// Create our Application instance (replace this with your appId and secret).
$meli = new Meli(123456, 'dsadsaDWFfs24DF34dgg43T3');
?>
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to contribute or you find something that needs to be fixed, just fork our SDK in [GitHub](https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk) and pull requests as needed.
